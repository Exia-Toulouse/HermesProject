<p>Hermes Project is maintained by Exia CESI Toulouse A4L.
This repository is for educational purpose only and you can use it as an example for any
engineering project. <br /> Each process and step are documented below.</p>

# Chronology

<p>The chronology included below demonstrates the work done in a very short amount of time.
<br />Each part of the project has been represented inside.</p>

# Mind Map

<p>A mind map is a diagram used to visually organize information.
Often used during brainstorming session, Mind Maps are particulary suited in order to understand
concept and ideas during team sessions. </p>

<p>The Mind Map below shows the entire project area, with all particularities and was drawn during the opening
session of the project. The objective was to find the more constraints as possible in order to make easiest the future designing session.</p>
