# Hermes Project

Hermes Project is an autonomous connected device in order to store alerts during shipping.
This project is able to handle various form of data, including:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- GPS
- Acceleration and Angular Acceleration
- Angular Position
- DateTime
- Light level

Hermes Project is maintained by Exia CESI Toulouse A4L.
This repository is for educational purpose only and you can use it as an example for any
engineering project. 
Each process and step are documented below.
